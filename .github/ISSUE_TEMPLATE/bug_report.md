üíöüíú Thank you for interest. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ
**Please** make sure to check for more efficient package management.

**To Reproduce**
- [ ] I have read [README.md](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Gemini-API). Please read me.
- [ ] I have searched for existing issues and [FAQ](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Gemini-API/blob/main/documents/README_FAQ.md) *(Most of the issues are duplicates.)*
- [ ] I installed the appropriate version and confirmed that the previous version was properly removed upon reinstallation. 
- [ ] I also checked the environment (not only on a single local machine but also on Google Colab, different Google accounts, and tried resetting cookies, etc. Please make sure to attempt these steps if necessary, and test the functionality in a new virtual environment if needed.)

Example
```
pip uninstall python-gemini-api            # and restart kernel
pip install python-gemini-api==2.0.0       # check proper version
pip install -u python-gemini-api==2.0.0    # upgrade version
```

```python
import gemini
gemini.__version__
```

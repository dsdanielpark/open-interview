```
```
git clone https://github.com/dsdanielpark/open-interview.git

```

<br>


### Quick Start   

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NWCwuunRRR2C2b0vmYk6Tm-JxV4yzSt9#scrollTo=bebO3UiGbIaD) 





Generate interview content using Claude or GPT models with minimal setup:

#### Using Claude

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Increasing the `iteration` argument can generate more QAs but may lead to duplicates and excessive token usage, as it's an experimental feature.


```python
from openinterview import InterviewManager

claudeToken = "<your_claude_token>"
claude_interview_manager = InterviewManager(api_key=claudeToken, engine="Claude")

jd = """
The 'jd', 'resume', and other arguments
can accommodate extensive text.
"""

claude_interview_manager.generate_interview(
    jd=jd,
    resume="path/resume.pdf or path/resume.txt or long text.",
    position= "AI Researcher",
    interview_type="techQAsFromResume",
    language="English", # Any language you want
    max_sentence=5,
    output_dir="save/dirs",
    iteration=1, # [Caution] You can make more QAs, But it cost token very fastly.
)
```

#### Using GPT

```python
import openai
from openinterview import InterviewManager

openai.api_key = "<your_openai_token>"
gpt_interview_manager = InterviewManager(api_key=openai.api_key, engine="GPT")

gpt_interview_manager.generate_interview(
    jd="This role demands a deep enthusiasm for AI development.", # Feasible for long text
    resume="path/resume.pdf or path/resume.txt or long text.",
    position= "AI Researcher",
    interview_type="techQAsFromResume",
    language="English", # Any language you want
    max_sentence=5,
    output_dir="save/dirs",
    iteration=1, # [Caution] You can make more QAs, But it cost token very fastly.
)
```



Interview_type arguments as follow:
  - *generalQAs*: Ask about technical and personal skills in-depth.
  - *generalTechQAs*: Ask basic professional questions related to the job.
  - *techQAsFromResume*: Focus on technical skills listed on the resume.
  - *techQAsFromExperts*: Questions based on interviewer's expertise.
  - *techQAs*: Questions based on both parties' experiences.
  - *personalityQAs*: Inquire about personal qualities.
  - *reviewResume*: Identify and suggest improvements for the resume.


#### Playing Random Question Audio

To randomly play `question.mp3` files from a specified folder, create an instance of the `RandomPlayer` class with the folder path, and then invoke `play_random_mp3`:

```python
from openinterview import RandomPlayer

player = RandomPlayer(directory="path/to/output", interval=120)  # Directory containing question.mp3 files
player.play_random_mp3()
```
Default plays randomly for 2 minutes. Press 'n' for next question, 'q' to quit.
